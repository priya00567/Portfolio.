                    <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
                    <p> Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. 
                        Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the websiteâ€™s overall functionality.
                        Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.There are two main ways to design a website: using
                        a desktop app or using a website builder. The tool you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size,
                        your budget, and the type of site you wish to build and its technical requirements.    </p>

                        <p> UX design, or user experience design, is the method by which design teams build products that meet the 
                            brand promise of a company while providing meaningful user experiences for customers.
                            All aspects of the product's design and usability must be considered in order to ensure a positive user experience. 
                            Among the many responsibilities of a UI/UX Designer are conducting research and understanding user needs. </p>
